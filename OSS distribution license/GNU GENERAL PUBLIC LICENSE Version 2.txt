TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
   placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
   this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program
   or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
   derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
   Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
   translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
   limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

...

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
   forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
   or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
   these conditions:

   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you
      changed the files and the date of any change.

   b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in
      part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
      licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
      License.

   c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you
      must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
      ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
      copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that
      you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
      these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
      (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print
      such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
      an announcement.)

...

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
   However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
   or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept
   this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
   based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
   all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program
   or works based on it.

...

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
   General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
   spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
   or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a
   version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you
   have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or
   of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
   does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever
   published by the Free Software Foundation.
